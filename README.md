# Trust QR

Trust QR is a platform that uses Blockchain technology and QR codes to combat counterfeiting. Companies can register their products on the platform, and each product will be assigned a unique QR code. Consumers can scan the QR code on a product to validate product authenticity, ensuring it matches the stated brand and providing manufacturing and expiry date details.
Product and User data are stored in blockchain using smart contracts.
